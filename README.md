# etch-a-sketch
* About: <br/>
    * This project is comprised of html, css & js.
    * It is basically a sketch paper with different sort of controls like changing colors, reset grid size, choosing color, random grid etc. 
* Current Issues: <br />
    * All necessary requirements are completed.
    * "Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black." After 10 passes, square is black but didn't understand rest.
    * On some grid sizes, a bottom scroll pops up. Specially on higher grid sizes like may above 80 ones. 
* Future Ideas: <br />
    * Grid size to be changed dynamically on different resolutions instead of using scroll. Any other work around to get rid of scroll. 
    * Adding more options maybe
    * deep random colors instead of current ones.
